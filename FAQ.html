	<h2 ><font color="#69D2E7"> What is the FDA doing to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic?
	</font>
	</h2>

	<p>A: The FDA, along with other federal, state, and local agencies and public health officials</p>
	<p> across the country and internationally, plays a critical role in protecting public health</p>
	<p> during the COVID-19 pandemic. FDA staff are working around the clock to support</p>
	<p> development of  medical countermeasures and are providing regulatory advice, guidance,</p>
	<p> and technical assistance to advance the development and availability of vaccines</p>
	<p>, therapies, diagnostic tests and other medical devices for use diagnosing, treating, and </p>
	<p>preventing this novel virus. The FDA continues to monitor the human and animal food</p>
	<p> supply and take swift action on fraudulent COVID-19 products.</p>
	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">Do COVID-19 vaccines require approval by WHO, prior to using it in a country?</font></h2>

	<p>No, WHO’s Emergency Use Listing (EUL) assesses the quality, safety and efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines</p>
	<p> and is a prerequisite for COVAX Facility vaccine supply. It also allows countries to expedite their own regulatory approval to import and administer COVID-19 vaccines.</p>

	<p>However, countries and national regulatory authorities (NRA) can approve the use of a COVID-19 vaccine in a country without the vaccine having received WHO’s EUL.</p>

	<p>Only those vaccines that have proven to be safe and effective at preventing the disease will be approved to be used in the population.</p>

	 
	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">When will I be able to get vaccinated against COVID-19?</font></h2>

	<p>PAHO encourages the people of the Americas to follow information from their national health authorities to determine when COVID-19 vaccines will be</p>
	<p> available in each country of the Region.</p>

	 
	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">How will individuals access COVID-19 vaccines?</font></h2>

	As vaccines against COVID-19 are available, individuals will be able to access them through their countries´ National Immunization Programs.

	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">Are mRNA vaccines safe?</font></h2>

	<p>mRNA vaccines are being held to the same rigorous safety standards as all other vaccines. Vaccines are not approved or rolled out for use in the</p>
	<p> general population until the safety data has been thoroughly reviewed by regulatory agencies and WHO.</p>

 
	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">Do COVID-19 vaccines contain any dangerous and toxic ingredients?</font></h2>

	<p>No. Although the ingredients on vaccine labels can be alarming (e.g. thiomersal , aluminum, formaldehyde), these substances are generally found</p>
	<p> naturally in the human body, in the food we eat and in the environment around us, such as the tuna we eat. The amounts contained in vaccines are very</p>
	<p> small and will not "poison" or harm the body.</p>

	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">Is it better to get COVID-19 naturally than to get vaccinated against it?</font></h2>

	<p>No. Vaccines build immunity without the damaging effects that COVID-19 can have, including long-term effects and death. Allowing the disease to</p>
	<p> spread until herd immunity is reached could cause millions of deaths and even more people living with the long-term effects of the virus.</p>

 
	<h2><font color="#69D2E7">How long does the immunity given by the COVID-19 vaccine last?</font></h2>

	<p>As of January 2021, there are still many unknowns for most of the COVID-19 candidate vaccines being developed. Of those vaccines that have been </p>
	<p>granted Emergency Use Authorizations, we still do not know how long the vaccines´ protection lasts. This question and others will be answered in the</p>
	<p> coming months, as the vaccines are further studied</p>
